Hi Todd,

Thank you for reaching out about the Senior Software Solution Architect position in Zurich.

I'm currently focused on building NodeAI, an enterprise AI agentic platform that enables organizations to create, orchestrate, and optimize AI agent workflows. The platform includes multi-provider LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), RAG capabilities, cost intelligence, and a visual workflow canvas - work that aligns closely with autonomous systems architecture.

While I'm not actively seeking new opportunities at the moment, I'd be happy to review the job description. The role sounds interesting, particularly the focus on robotics and automation architecture. However, I should note that I'm currently based in [Your Location] and would need to consider the relocation aspect for a Zurich-based position.

If you'd like to share the details, I'm happy to take a look and see if there might be a fit, or I can potentially refer someone from my network who might be a better match.

Best regards,
Efuetngong
